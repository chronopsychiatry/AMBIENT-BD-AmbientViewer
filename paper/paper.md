# Summary


# Statement of need

Radar technology has recently emerged as a useful tool for longitudinal sleep monitoring for wellbeing and research. It has for example been used in the Ambient-BD study (cite), where Somnofy devices (VitalThings) were used to monitor the sleep of 180 participants over 18 months. Somnofy is a promising tool for research applications, as it allows long-term, non-intrusive sleep monitoring, with minimal maintenance. This can be harnessed to pick up long-term trends in sleep and circadian rhythm, and monitor related health outcomes. However, due to the novelty of this technology, few specialised tools are currently available for the analysis of radar-derived sleep data, as is produced by Somnofy. Ambient Viewer enables users of all coding abilities to:
- Explore Somnofy data
- Assess the quality of the data and improve it using dedicated filters
- Generate metrics and visualisations that are specific to sleep data

# Overview of Ambient Viewer

Ambient Viewer can be used through a graphical interface (running online or locally), or as an R package.

## Graphical interface

The Ambient Viewer graphical interface is conceived as a dashboard, where the different information and menus are easily reachable. It contains five main areas:
- Data input
- Data filtering
- Data export
- Tables
- Figures

The application is reactive, allowing for direct feedback on the effect of data filters.

## R package

Main functionalities and usefulness compared to app.
