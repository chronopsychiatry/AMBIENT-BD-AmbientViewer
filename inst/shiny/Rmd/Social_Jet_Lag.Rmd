##### Definition

Social Jet-Lag (SJL) is the mismatch in midsleep time between work days (MSW) and free days (MSF).

![Formula to compute Social Jet-Lag (SJL)](../../resources/SJL_1.png)

âš  SJL is only valid if there is a single sleep episode per night. Check there are no sessions shown in the compliance tab.

##### Interpretation

Lower SJL values indicate more similar sleep patterns between work days and free days.
