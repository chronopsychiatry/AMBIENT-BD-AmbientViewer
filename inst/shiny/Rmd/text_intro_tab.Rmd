### Data types

- **Sessions**: each row represents a sleep session. The session data is expected to contain sleep onset and wakeup times
- **Epochs**: each row represents a time epoch (e.g. 30 seconds). The epoch data is expected to contain timestamps and sleep stage annotations

### Workflow

1. Import data
  - Supported formats: .csv, .txt, .edf, .rec, .xlsx
  - Session and epoch data can be imported separately or together
  - Column names for essential variables (e.g. timestamps, sleep stages) can be specified
2. Filter data
  - Filter sessions to exclude spurious sleep events
  - When sessions are filtered, the corresponding epochs are filtered as well
3. Visualise data
  - When sessions and epochs are filtered, the tables and visualisations are updated accordingly
4. Export filtered data
  - Data can be exported as CSV files for further analyses
  - A sleep report in PDF format can be generated
