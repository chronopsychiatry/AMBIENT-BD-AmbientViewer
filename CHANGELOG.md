# 0.0.1 (06/05/2025)

**New**

- Updated the Sleep clock to show the duration of sleep sessions
- Added "Sleep onset & wakeup", a horizontal bar graph that shows sleep onset and wakeup times aggregated either by night, days of the week, or weekend/weekday.
- Added an option to export plots in PDF format

**Fixed**

- Defined better presets for dimensions of exported plots
- Fixed a timezone issue that was sometimes causing sleep onset and wakeup from sessions to be shifted by 1 hour
